- This is just my coding challenge btw, i don't mean wanna implement this to working web application (or maybe sometime, if i have free time ? :'V')
- Feel free to use, modify, distribute this script as you want ! 
- Made with <3 by David Mahbubi

### How to user

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine
- Clone this repository
- There are 2 files which contain literally same algorithm, just different on method declaration, choose one that you prefer to go
- Edit your choosen file as you wish (for example changing the ip decimal)
- Execute it by using node file_name.js
