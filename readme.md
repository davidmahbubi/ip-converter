# IP (Dec to Binary Converter)

- This is just my coding challenge, i don't mean to implement this stuff into working web application (or maybe sometime, if i have free time ? 😁)
- Made with <3 by David Mahbubi
- Of course the algorithm in this project is not really clean / efficient as you expect (Because the challenge is limited on time, so i just write everything that come to my brain ✌)

### How to use

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine
- Clone this repository
- There are 2 files which contain literally same algorithm, just different on method declaration, choose one that you prefer to go
- Edit your choosen file as you wish (for example changing the ip decimal)
- Execute it by using node file_name.js
